- It supports full `.NET` framework and `.NET Core`.
- You should always start from [CoreNLP](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stanford.NLP.CoreNLP/) master package that provide full range of features (other packages are exist for historical/compatibility reasons)
- Use [official CoreNLP site](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/demo.html) for latest docs, samples and demos. Site is maintained by library authors.

### Versioning

Versioning model used for NuGet packages is aligned to versioning used by Stanford NLP Group. For example, if you get Stanford CoreNLP distribution from [Stanford NLP site](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml) with version `3.9.1`, then the NuGet version of this package has a version `3.9.1.x`, where `x` is the greatest that is available on NuGet. Last number is used for internal versioning of .NET assemblies.
